# Graph Neural Network Characterization

This project implements graph neural networks from scratch and compares them to each other.

## Different GNNs implemented

* Graph Convolutional Networks
* Graph Isomorphism Networks
* Recurrent Neural Networks (as a graph)

## Datasets tested on

* Citeseer citation network
* IMDB sentiment recognition
